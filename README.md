Youtube Mp3 Downloader - Terminal version

- Add links from YouTube videos to Playlist.txt
- Links have to be of this shape: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
- The MP3s are displayed in a separate folder called Music, which is created at runtime. The music is downloaded to music/yourgivenpath 

	Example:

		Rock/Billy Talent															
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAOnUF8t20								
		Rock/Thousands Foot Krutch
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqMbGQx05jg			
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpDEOXABWg

		istasha										
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hjeMlNVvP4					
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsP

- Alternatively, just provide the links and the songs will be downloaded to the music folder of this directory								

	Example:	
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hjeMlNVvP4
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAOnUF8t20										
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrFI2gJSuwA
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsP								
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAOnUF8t20

If that explanation doesn't do the trick, simply try both examples by adding the blocks to the playlist.txt file. After the program has ended, you can put the output music in the desired folder and delete the music folder from this directory again.

Your operating system may warn you about using the software, but fear not, most security systems will not cover Python code as it is complicated to check. Hence, security is just trying to block them


Hello Guen.

Unfortunately, our normal Antivirus routine declares most of "user based scripts" or codes as malicious. That is also the reason why the .dll got flagged and quarantined. But as my understanding, they don't change the ownership rights at all.

There should be 2 Ways to solve the problem. 

First one is to whitelist the Script / code or even the whole folder. You can find more information under the following link:

Second one is to contact directly our virus lab team and sending them the file/s which are flagged.

They will check the file/s and send you additional information why it got flagged and how to solve this.
