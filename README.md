Youtube Mp3 Downloader - Terminal version

- Add links from YouTube videos to Playlist.txt
- Links have to be of this shape: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
- The MP3s are displayed in a separate folder called Music, which is created at runtime. The music is downloaded to music/yourgivenpath 

	Example:

		Rock/Billy Talent															
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAOnUF8t20								
		Rock/Thousands Foot Krutch
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqMbGQx05jg			
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpDEOXABWg

		istasha

		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsP

- Alternatively, just provide the links and the songs will be downloaded to the music folder of this directory								

	Example:	
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hjeMlNVvP4
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAOnUF8t20										
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrFI2gJSuwA
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsP								
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAOnUF8t20
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqMbGQx05jg


If that explanation doesn't do the trick, simply try both examples by adding the blocks to the playlist.txt file. After the program has ended, you can put the output music in the desired folder and delete the music folder from this directory again.
